## Results
* This folder is automatically generated once the executable has been generated and run.
* Two files are generated:
    * `solution.csv`.
    * `error.csv`.

* These files have been provided along with an image (`png`) of the solution `u(x, y)` and the error between the `computed` and `analytic` solutions.
* If you don't want this data run:
* `$ make clean`, to get rid of the `results` directory.
